# SKILLS OVERVIEW

1. Series—Understanding what a series is and how we can retrieve selected values from a series.

2. Data frames—Constructing data frames and retrieving selected values from a data frame.

3. Import and export—Reading and writing files in different formats, including CSV and JSON.

4. Indexes—Setting and retrieving indexes and multi-indexes.

5. Cleaning—Turning messy, real-world data into a form we can use more easily: for example, identifying duplicates, handling missing values, and removing unnecessary and incorrect data.

6. Grouping, joining, and sorting—The core of much pandas functionality: grouping data, joining multiple data frames, and sorting by both indexes and values. These topics are so important that two chapters address them.

7. Advanced grouping, joining, and sorting—Deeper examination of the techniques introduced in chapter 6.

8. Project—Completing a large project based on the Python developer survey.

9. Strings—Working with text data from within pandas.

10. Dates—Working with date and time data from within pandas.

11. Visualization—Plotting both via the pandas API and using the Seaborn module.

12. Performance—Optimizing the speed and memory usage of our data.

13. Final project—Completing a large project examining American colleges and universities.
