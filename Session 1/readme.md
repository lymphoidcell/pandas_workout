# Pandas Tutorial

This repository contains an IPython notebook (`pandas_workout_session 1.ipynb`) that provides an introduction to Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python. The notebook covers the basic concepts of Pandas, including its data structures and how to perform boolean indexing (mask indexing).

## Introduction to Pandas

Pandas is an open-source library that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python. It is built on top of the NumPy library and is particularly well-suited for working with structured data.

## Pandas Data Structures

### Series

A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold any data type such as integers, floats, strings, and Python objects. It is similar to a column in a spreadsheet or a database table.

#### Understanding Series

In the notebook, we will cover:

- What a Series is and its basic features.
- How to create a Series from different data sources.
- How to retrieve selected values from a Series using various indexing methods.

## Boolean Indexing (Mask Indexing)

Boolean indexing, also known as mask indexing, is a powerful feature in Pandas that allows you to filter data based on certain conditions. This technique is useful for subsetting data, performing conditional operations, and more.

In the notebook, you will learn:

- How to use boolean indexing to filter rows and columns in a DataFrame.
- How to combine multiple conditions using logical operators.
- Practical examples demonstrating the use of boolean indexing in data manipulation tasks.

## Exercises

The study case will include:

- Test scores
- Scaling test scores
- Counting tens digits
- Descriptive statistics
- Monday temperatures
- Passenger frequency
- Long, medium, and short taxi rides

## Usage

To run the notebook, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. If you do not have it installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
